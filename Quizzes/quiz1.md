<font size="+2">1. </font> Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following is an example of a replication of my study?

<hr>
<font size="+1"> <b>

<hr>
<hr>
<font size="+2">2. </font> Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?

<hr>
<hr>
<font size="+2">3. </font> Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?

<hr>
<font size="+1"> <b>

-   The study's analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are publicly available. When the code is run on the analytic data, the findings are identical to the published results.

</b> </font>

<hr>

</b> </font>

<hr>
<hr>
<font size="+2">6. </font> What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?

</b> </font>

<hr>
<font size="+2">8. </font>What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?

<hr>
<font size="+1"> <b>
